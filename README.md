- “analysis.ipynb”  the Jupyter notebook that reads in the data and carries out the analysis and produces plots for the paper.
- “idealized.ipynb” the Jupyter notebook applying an idealized form of the popultion dynamics equations derived in the manuscript
- “corals_small_br.xlsx” contains the small coral colony observations for the back reef sites as surveyed at the Hilton in 2015
- “corals_small_fr.xlsx” contains the small coral colony observations for the forereef at both LTER1 and LTER2 sites for three different years.
- “corals_backreef.csv” contains the coral abundance data on the back reef at both sites between 2011-2018
- “corals_forereef.csv” contains the coral abundance data on the fore reef at both sites between 2011-2018
- “lter1.nc” is a NetCDF file containing 100 Monte Carlo hindcasts of population trajectories for LTER1 fore reef and back reef sites
- “lter2.nc” is a NetCDF file containing 100 Monte Carlo hindcasts of population trajectories for LTER2 fore reef and back reef sites
